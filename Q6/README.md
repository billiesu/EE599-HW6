# Question 6 (20 Points. Medium)

## Given a vector of integers v, and an index i in the vector, rearrange the vector such that all items less than or equal to v[i] are on the left, and all items greater than v[i] are on the right side. Note:

    ● The left and right side don’t need to be sorted.
    ● You can assume i is always within v’s boundaries.
    ● Your algorithm should be O(n)

# Example:
    Input: v= [9, 7, 5, 11, 12, 2, 14, 3, 10, 6], i=9. 
    Output: [5, 2, 3, 6, 12, 7, 14, 9, 10, 11] Note that there are multiple correct outputs. 
    For example, the following is also a valid output: Output: [5, 3, 2, 6, 14, 7, 12, 9, 10, 11]
