# Question 3 (20 Points. Medium)

## Consider the following representation of a graph using an std::map that maps each vertex to its neighbors, and the sample usage of it:

    ● Add a new method to this class to implement the `non-recursive` version of `DFS` algorithm.
    ● Your function should take a vertex called `root` as the starting point, and should `output a vector` containing the nodes that it visits in DFS order.

# Question 4 (20 Points. Easy)

## For the Graph class in Question 2, please write a method called DFS_ALL(), where it ensures that all nodes are visited and returns the visited nodes in DFS order in a vector.

    ● Note: DFS_ALL() `doesn’t have any input` parameters.
