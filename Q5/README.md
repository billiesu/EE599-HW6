# Question 5 (20 Points. Medium)

## You are given a maze, a start and an end point, find out if there is at least one path from start to end.

    ● The maze is a grid where some cells are blocked and you cannot go there.
    ● You can only move to the right, left, down, or up. You cannot move diagonally..
    ● The maze is represented by a 2x2 vector where a 0 represents a blocked and 1 represents a free cell.
    ● Start and End are specified as pairs: (i,j), where i is the row, and j is the column.
    ● Notice that you don’t need to generate the path. Just find out if at least one path exists.
